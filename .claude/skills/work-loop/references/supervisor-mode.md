**Default is sequential implementer dispatch.** Supervisor mode computes the
plan's full `Depends on:` DAG (`loop-cohort schedule <spec-dir>`) and, when an
`implementer` subagent is installed, dispatches each plan task in topological
order with one implementer at a time. It does *not* auto-fan-out. `schedule`
stops the run on a dependency cycle. It reports a forward reference (a task
whose declared dependency is authored later) on stderr, corrects the wave order
so the dependency runs first, and continues. A `Depends on:` entry that
names no task in the plan is refused: `schedule` exits non-zero and names every
offending task→dependency pair without persisting any state. The field is read
up to its first `(`, so an ID written inside or after parenthetical prose is
commentary rather than a declared dependency — it is neither scheduled as an
edge nor reported as unknown.

This file owns the **opt-in parallel-write path** only. It is entered
deliberately — never automatically — and only for a wave that clears the
**dispatch gate**, which has two halves checked at two points:

- **Category half — auto-derived from the diff.** You **don't hand-classify**:
  omit `--category` and `dispatch-decision` derives each task's category from
  its branch's committed diff, fail-closed (only an all-added, no-danger-path
  diff is `cannot-collide`; rename/delete, danger-paths, modified-existing, and
  cross-branch basename/dir collisions all serialize). Pass `--category` only
  to **override** — the sole way to assert the two human-judged safe categories,
  neither auto-derived: `typed-group-b` (a type-shaped change) and `textual-loud`
  (append-mostly textual edits whose collisions surface as *loud* merge-tree
  conflicts rather than silent semantic breakage). Deciding either isn't
  fail-closed-mechanizable, which is why neither is auto-derived. (The three
  together are the `SAFE_CATEGORIES` the dispatch gate accepts.)
- **Disjointness half — on populated branches.** A clean `git merge-tree`
  file-disjointness check is only meaningful once the implementers have
  written and committed, so it is enforced at the **merge** step (step 5's
  `git merge --no-ff` aborts on any collision — the loud backstop). The
  read-only **preview** of that check is `loop-cohort dispatch-decision
  --branch <b> …` (categories auto-derived), which classifies each branch and
  then calls `dispatch_decision(categories, merge_tree_clean=…)` to print
  `parallel` or `serial`. Read that signature carefully: the function
  **consumes** a merge-tree verdict its caller hands it — it does not compute
  one, and no part of the shipped scripts runs `git merge-tree`. The producer
  of that verdict is **unbuilt**, so the preview cannot be relied on for
  disjointness; step 5's aborting merge is where the check actually runs.
- **Even earlier — `Touches:` screen (optional).** If the plan's tasks declare
  `Touches:` globs, `loop-cohort schedule` prints `predicted-disjoint:
  yes|no|unknown` per wave. Treat a `no` as a reason to keep the wave serial
  *before* dispatch; `yes`/`unknown` change nothing — they **never** greenlight
  (the merge-tree check above stays the sole authority). Serialize-only screen.

Any non-safe category, or any merge-tree conflict, stays serial. Reviewer
(read) fan-out is a separate, always-safe path.

**Present the cleared-gate opportunity.** When `dispatch-decision` returns
`parallel`, branch on `state.json.auto_parallel` (set per-run via `loop-cohort
auto-parallel`, default off):

- **`auto_parallel` unset (default):** do not enter the procedure below
  silently — **present the cleared-gate opportunity to the human** (the
  parallel-eligible wave and its tasks; the verb's stderr rationale is the line
  to relay) and take the parallel path **only on an explicit opt-in**. Absent
  one, run the wave sequentially — the safe default. Present-and-default-safe,
  not the halt-and-wait Surface verb, so — *with `auto_parallel` unset* — an
  unattended run proceeds sequentially rather than blocking.
- **`auto_parallel` set:** the human pre-authorized this run; a **gate-cleared**
  wave enters the parallel procedure below **without** the opt-in (this is what
  lets a plan finish unattended). **GO-approval-only** — it skips only the
  human-confirm step for an **already-cleared** wave; it is never a gate input,
  never enters the parallel path for a wave the gate didn't clear, and a failed
  parallel wave (step-5 merge-abort, or a blocked/failed implementer at step 4)
  still **Surfaces and stops** — never auto-retries or relaxes a gate.

The trigger and concept stay in [`../SKILL.md` § EXECUTE](../SKILL.md); this
file owns the step-by-step procedure once the opt-in parallel path is taken.

Throughout this procedure, **"task-id order" means numeric where IDs
look like `T1`, `T2`, … ; lexicographic otherwise.** The `loop-cohort`
tool sorts by the same rule when merging.

The [parallel-dispatch discipline](#parallel-dispatch-discipline) is the same
as for REVIEW fan-out. References to it below mean that section.

Every state mutation — worktree creation, report persistence, status
updates, merges, cleanup — is owned by the `loop-cohort` tool at
`../scripts/loop-cohort.py`. The tool guarantees the match-first /
write-second / state-update-last ordering and atomic JSON writes; do
not edit `state.json` or invoke `git worktree` directly.

## The procedure

0. **Pre-flight: surface stale worktrees.** Run

   ```
   loop-cohort.py worktree preflight docs/specs/<feature> <task-id> ...
   ```

   The tool runs `git worktree prune`, then checks for `.worktrees/<task-id>/`
   directories or `<base-branch>-<task-id>` branches left behind by a
   prior session. Non-zero exit means a previous run left scratch
   behind — **surface to a human; do not silently reuse or destroy.**
   The scratch may carry in-flight work the previous run was about to
   commit. Resume happens manually.

1. **Set up worktrees.** For each independent task `<task-id>`, run

   ```
   loop-cohort.py worktree add docs/specs/<feature> <task-id>
   ```

   The tool creates `.worktrees/<task-id>/` on branch
   `<base-branch>-<task-id>` and appends an
   `{task_id, branch, path, status: "in-progress", report_path: null}`
   entry to `state.json.worktrees`, atomically.

2. **Dispatch implementers in parallel** per the
   [parallel-dispatch discipline](#parallel-dispatch-discipline) below.
   Each brief includes: the task
   ID, the plan-task body, the worktree path, paths to the spec +
   plan, and an explicit **bundled-fixes authorization line** —
   "Bundled fixes authorized per the carve-out in `work-loop/SKILL.md`
   (EXECUTE phase); apply same-area, same-concern, mechanical
   ride-alongs only and report under `Bundled fixes:` in your output."
   If a particular task should run without the carve-out (e.g. a
   high-blast-radius migration), omit the authorization line; the
   implementer defaults to no-carve-out and routes everything to
   "Out of scope observed".

3. **Persist each report and update state.** For each returning
   subagent, write its markdown report to disk, then run

   ```
   loop-cohort.py worktree record docs/specs/<feature> <task-id> \
     --status {ready|blocked|failed} --report <path>
   ```

   The tool:
   1. Parses the report's opening `## Task <task-id>` heading and
      checks it matches the `<task-id>` argument. Mismatched or missing
      heading exits non-zero — never silently writing under an
      unvalidated name.
   2. Copies the report verbatim to
      `docs/specs/<feature>/notes/implementer-<task-id>-<iteration>.md`,
      where `<iteration>` is the current `state.json.implementation_retry_count`
      (Phase-1 field; Phase-2 may introduce a dedicated counter).
      On a fresh loop the value is `0`, so the first attempt lands as
      `…-0.md`; subsequent re-plans see the counter bumped (see step 4
      below) so reports never overwrite one another.
   3. Atomically updates the matching `state.json.worktrees[i]` entry:
      sets `status` and `report_path`.

   The match-first / write-second / state-update-last ordering is the
   tool's invariant; a crash between steps 2 and 3 leaves a recoverable
   signal — the report file exists, the entry still says
   `in-progress`, and the next supervisor session's pre-flight surfaces
   it as stale scratch.

4. **Handle non-ready tasks first.** Inspect `loop-cohort worktree list
   docs/specs/<feature>`. If any entry shows `blocked` or `failed`, do
   not merge. Surface the failed-task list (with `report_path`
   pointers), then return to PLAN and revise the offending task. The
   next supervisor pass's `worktree record` call (or `review record`
   on the surrounding loop) will bump `implementation_retry_count`, so report
   filenames won't collide. Do not redispatch the same implementer on
   the same task — the assumption that produced the failure is what
   needs revising, not the attempt.

5. **Merge ready tasks sequentially.** From the primary worktree, run

   ```
   loop-cohort.py worktree merge docs/specs/<feature>
   ```

   The tool sorts ready entries in task-id order and runs
   `git merge --no-ff <branch>` for each. A conflict means the tasks
   weren't actually independent — the tool runs `git merge --abort`,
   exits non-zero, and names the offending task ID. Return to PLAN and
   fix the `Depends on:` declarations.

   **Lift `Bundled fixes:` into the PR body.** Each implementer report
   may carry a `Bundled fixes:` section listing ride-alongs landed
   under the carve-out. After merge succeeds, collect those lines
   from every ready report, dedupe by exact-string match (falling
   back to operator judgment when two lines describe the same change
   in different words), and emit a single `Bundled fixes:` section
   in the PR description below the [standard template](../assets/pull-request-template.md). If no
   implementer landed ride-alongs, omit the section.

6. **Clean up worktrees.** After all merges succeed, run

   ```
   loop-cohort.py worktree cleanup docs/specs/<feature>
   ```

   The tool runs `git worktree remove` for each entry, retries once
   with `--force` on failure, and leaves stuck directories in place
   with their paths on stderr (exit 2). Surface those in your
   end-of-loop summary, but don't block on cleanup — the loop should
   still proceed to gates. Worktree entries in `state.json.worktrees`
   keep their terminal status for the rest of the loop so the next
   reader can reconstruct what each task did.

7. **Run gates yourself** (next phase in the parent SKILL). The
   implementers' gate results were advisory; the gates of record run
   in the primary against the merged state.

## Parallel-dispatch discipline

Both EXECUTE fan-out (supervisor mode) and REVIEW fan-out share these rules:

- Issue all subagent invocations in a single message (one Agent use per target).
  Do not call sequentially.
- Barrier-wait: don't issue follow-on Agent calls until every subagent in the
  round has returned.
- Timeout, tool error, or missing report = `failed` for that target. Same as
  substantive failure; don't retry silently.
- EXECUTE fan-out: merge implementer results in your own context. REVIEW
  fan-out: persist each raw report, classify it with `review raw-classify`,
  adjudicate by path every one that is not footer-free `clean`, and merge only the
  sustained main-loop results; never read N raw reviewer reports into the
  controller to aggregate them. Persistence is unconditional — a fan-out round
  where every reviewer returned clean still leaves one artifact per reviewer.

## Phase 1 supervisor procedure

Read `loop-cohort status docs/specs/<feature> --json` for
`current_wave_index` and `schedule_waves[current_wave_index]` to get the active
task set. (`schedule` runs once during the G-plan sequence and persists the
wave list; re-calling it resets `current_wave_index` to 0, erasing prior `wave
advance` progress.) Dispatch `implementer` tasks sequentially — **parallel fan-out
(`dispatch-decision`, `worktree`, `auto-parallel`) is disabled in Phase 1**;
those verbs exit non-zero. Record one `dispatch-receipt` per task as you go.
After all wave tasks are done, run the wave-exit check and fire `wave-complete`
before proceeding to GATES:

```
python '<skill-dir>/scripts/loop-cohort.py' dispatch-receipt docs/specs/<feature> \
    --task <task-id> --wave-index <n> --receipt --expect-run-id <run_id>
# Read-only. It refuses a wave exit whose tasks are unaccounted for, and prints
# the absent-container notice the transition itself cannot carry.
python '<skill-dir>/scripts/loop-cohort.py' check docs/specs/<feature> --phase wave-exit
python '<skill-dir>/scripts/loop-engine.py' transition docs/specs/<feature> wave-complete
```

## Single-agent fallback

If no `implementer`-matching subagent is installed in the consumer's
IDE, drop back to single-agent mode: execute the independent tasks
yourself, sequentially, in task-id order. Note the degradation in the
final summary so the user sees the loop ran without implementer dispatch.
The missing capability is the subagent, not parallelism — the installed path
is sequential too.

Each task you execute yourself still needs its own record, so the wave can
account for every task. Record it as a decline, not a receipt, and pick the
reason from the closed set of two:

- `no-implementer-installed` — what the controller records when no
  `implementer`-matching subagent is installed in the consumer's IDE. This is
  the code for the fallback this section describes.
- `human-directed` — records a human instruction to skip implementer dispatch
  for that task. It has no testable precondition: nothing on disk can confirm
  the instruction, so this code asserts only that the controller was told.

```
python '<skill-dir>/scripts/loop-cohort.py' dispatch-receipt docs/specs/<feature> \
    --task <task-id> --wave-index <n> --decline no-implementer-installed \
    --expect-run-id <run_id>
```

**Unsupported `schema_version` is asymmetric, and the asymmetry stops the run.**
Each half below is stated whole, because the exit half alone reads as permission
to continue.

- **The exit tolerates that class.** `check --phase wave-exit` passes any cohort state whose `schema_version` is not the supported one, before reading any other field, so a run that predates receipts still reaches its wave boundary.
- **The verb refuses that class.** `dispatch-receipt`, like every mutation verb, stops with `unsupported schema_version=… (expected 1); run reset pair` and writes nothing, so no record can be added to that state.
- **End to end, the run cannot pass the next wave boundary without a schema migration.** `wave advance` refuses on the same schema check, so the cohort wave pointer never moves however the exit itself decided. Migrate the state with the reset pair rather than reading the tolerated exit as progress.

## Why a separate mode, and its boundary

**Supervisor mode is wave-scheduled and sequential in Phase 1.** The
work-loop builds the plan's full `Depends on:` DAG (`loop-cohort schedule`) and
dispatches plan tasks in topological order with one `implementer` at a time —
failing loud on a cycle and warning on a forward-reference. Parallel
`implementer` fan-out (`dispatch-decision`, `worktree`, `auto-parallel`) is
**disabled in Phase 1** — those verbs exit non-zero without touching
`state.json`. The design intent for opt-in parallel fan-out and the step-by-step
worktree procedure live in the `work-loop` skill §EXECUTE and
`references/supervisor-mode.md`. This section is the why and the boundary.

**Why a separate mode instead of a separate skill.** The trigger is
structural (the plan's shape), not a choice the user makes. Branching
inside `work-loop` means contributors never pick the wrong skill, and
the 80% overlap with single-agent flow stays single-sourced.

**Why an implementer subagent, not a recursive work-loop.** The
implementer's job is narrow — build one task, run gates, report.
Reviewing, dispatch decisions, and merge belong to the supervisor. A
recursive work-loop would let an implementer spawn its own
implementers; that's nested coordination overhead with no clear win.
Keep the tree two levels deep: supervisor → leaf implementers.

**Worktrees as the coordination primitive.** Each independent task gets
`.worktrees/<task-id>/` checked out on its own branch
(`<base-branch>-<task-id>`). Worktrees are git-native, support parallel
checkout of the same repo, and avoid lockfile contention. The directory
is gitignored ([`.gitignore`](../.gitignore)); branches live in git
history for traceability.

**Merge discipline.** The supervisor merges with `git merge --no-ff
<base>-<task-id>` into the primary branch, **sequentially in task-id
order**. The procedure file
(`references/supervisor-mode.md` in the `work-loop` skill)
has the executable form (including how to order non-numeric IDs). If a
sequential merge conflicts, the tasks weren't actually independent —
the plan was wrong. Surface that as a PLAN-level escalation, not a
`git mergetool` session.

**Gates run in the primary, not the worktree.** Each implementer runs
gates inside its worktree and reports the result, but those results are
**advisory**. The supervisor reruns lint / typecheck / tests against
the merged state — that's the only signal that counts.

**Escalating implementer failures.** If an implementer reports
`blocked` or `failed`, the supervisor surfaces the failure list to a
human and returns to PLAN. It does **not** redispatch the same
implementer on the same task — the assumption that produced the
failure is what needs revising, not the attempt.

**Known limitation.** The procedure has been validated by prose
walk-through, not by an executed end-to-end dry-run. Any change to
**pre-flight (procedure step 0)**, **worktree creation (step 1)**,
**report persistence ordering (step 3)**, **merge order (step 5)**,
**cleanup recovery (step 6)**, or the **`state.json` `worktrees`
schema** must perform an actual `git worktree add` + parallel-dispatch
round against a throwaway spec before merging — read-only walk-through
is not sufficient for those surfaces. Step numbers refer to the
procedure at `references/supervisor-mode.md` in the `work-loop` skill.
