"""Generate a decision-record index from the records in a directory.

The index is derived from each record's own front matter, so it cannot
disagree with the corpus it describes. Point it at the directory holding the
records; it writes that directory's ``README.md``.

    index-records.py <record-dir>            # write the index
    index-records.py --check <record-dir>    # exit non-zero if it would change
    index-records.py --type adr <record-dir> # required only when empty

The record type is inferred from the records present. An empty directory
carries no evidence of its own type, and the two types publish different
placeholder text, so ``--type`` is required there.
