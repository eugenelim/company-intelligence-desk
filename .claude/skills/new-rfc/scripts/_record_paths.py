"""Shared path-confinement helper for record-directory scripts.

Loaded by path via importlib.util.spec_from_file_location; never imported by
bare name.  Entry points used by the sibling record-directory scripts:

  list_candidate_entries(directory) -> list[CandidateEntry]
    Returns entries sorted by name, each carrying the (st_dev, st_ino) seen
    while the directory was held open.  Refuses a symlinked supplied directory
    by opening it with O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY rather than by testing and then
    scanning, so no window separates the check from the listing.  Accepts a
    directory under a symlinked ancestor (macOS resolves /var through one).
    Raises EntryRefused when the directory is itself a symlink, and OSError
    when the directory cannot be scanned.

  classify_entry(entry) -> "regular" | "symlink" | "directory" | "other"
    Uses stat(follow_symlinks=False) so a symlink is never misclassified as a
    regular file.  Raises OSError when the entry cannot be statted.

  read_confined(root, path, expect=None) -> bytes
    Reads path using O_NOFOLLOW and a before/after (st_dev, st_ino) comparison
    so a symlink at the final component or a replacement race cannot redirect
    the read.  Pass expect=entry.identity to bind the read to the entry that
    was listed and classified, which the before/after pair alone cannot do.
    Refuses hard links (st_nlink > 1).
    Raises EntryRefused on a confinement failure and OSError on a read failure.

Derives confinement semantics from
packs/core/.apm/skills/work-loop/scripts/file_safety.py: O_NOFOLLOW on the
final component (and on parent directories when the platform supports dir_fd),
plus the before/after inode comparison and hard-link refusal.  Not imported
from there: file_safety.py belongs to another pack's skill, and these scripts
run standalone from their own projection.

    Derives semantics from file_safety.py: O_NOFOLLOW on the final component,
    a before/after inode comparison to detect a replacement between
    classification and read, and hard-link refusal (st_nlink > 1).  On
    platforms where dir_fd is supported, each parent directory is also opened
    with O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY so no path component can redirect the walk
    through a symlink.

    The confinement root is *root*; every path component is validated to remain
    within it.

    *expect* is the ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` the caller observed when it listed and
    classified the entry.  When given, the opened file must still have that
    identity.  Without it the before/after comparison below proves only that
    the file did not change between this function's own stat and open — it
    cannot see a substitution that happened earlier, between classification
    and this call, because the fresh stat would simply observe the replacement
    and agree with itself.  Passing *expect* is what makes the classification
    binding on the read.

    Limit, stated rather than implied: identity is ``(st_dev, st_ino)``, and an
    inode freed by an unlink can be reissued to the file created next.  A
    substitution that happens to land on the reused inode therefore compares
    equal.  This is not hypothetical — on Linux, unlink-then-create commonly
    reissues the same inode, so that substitution shape is *not* detected
    there, while a rename over the target is.  The check catches substitution
    by rename and by any allocation that lands elsewhere; it does not make the
    read atomic, which nothing short of holding the descriptor from listing
    through read would.

    Raises:
        EntryRefused: a confinement check failed (symlink, hard link, race, or
            path outside root).
