"""Allocate a typed ordinal for a repository intent filename.

Usage: python3 intent_ordinal.py --dir <repo-relative dir> --token <TOKEN>
       python3 intent_ordinal.py --check <repo-relative dir>

Allocation mode prints ``<TOKEN>-NNNN`` on stdout and exits 0, or exits 1 with
one fixed diagnostic token on stderr. Exit 1 never means "do not admit": the
caller writes the intent at the unprefixed path and records the cause. Check
mode reports records sharing a type and an ordinal in one directory, and exits
1 rather than reporting clean for a directory it could not fully read.

`max + 1` is computed per type over the directory unioned with the records
visible on ``origin``. Allocation unions; check does not, because a remote-only
collision is already committed and needs a reissue rather than a refusal.

The allocator never returns a plausible answer. Where the untyped ADR/RFC
helper falls back to ``0001``, this one returns nothing: for a malformed name
inside the typed namespace, for a scan it could not complete, for a remote view
it could not read, and for a bound it would have to exceed.
